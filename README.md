## ----> My current project is learning how to code in Python 🐍
## ----> I am interested in learning more about cognitive/behavioral neurobiology! I am fascinated with the diverse ways that humans compute thoughts and process the stimuli around them. I hope one day I will be able to code an algorithm that will allow us to replicate the continuously changing maze of neurons in a developing human brain. 
## ----> I love to read psychological thrillers and romances and write in my free time. I also love to go biking on my mountain bike and have picnics with my friends. I love meeting new people so please reach out if you want to talk about anything I listed about :)
