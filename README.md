----> My current project is learning how to code in Python 🐍
----> I am interested in learning more about cognitive/behavioral neurobiology! I am fascinated with the diverse ways that humans compute thoughts and process the stimuli around them. I hope one day I will be able to code an algorithm that will allow us to replicate the continuously changing maze of neurons in a developing human brain.
